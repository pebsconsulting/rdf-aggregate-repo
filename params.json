This is used to implement [SPARQL Datasets][].\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n    require 'rdf'\r\n    require 'rdf/nquads'\r\n    repo = RDF::Repository.load(\"http://ruby-rdf.github.com/rdf/etc/doap.nq\")\r\n    \r\n    # Instantiate a new aggregate repo based on an existing repo\r\n    aggregate = RDF::AggregateRepo.new(repo)\r\n    \r\n    # Use the default graph from the repo as the default graph of the aggregate\r\n    aggregate.add_default(false)\r\n    \r\n    # Use a single named graph\r\n    aggregate.add_named(RDF::URI(\"http://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me\"))\r\n\r\n    # Retrieve all contexts\r\n    aggreggate.contexts.to_a #=> [RDF::URI(\"http://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me\")]\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n* [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/) (>= 1.8.7) or (>= 1.8.1 with [Backports][])\r\n* [RDF.rb][] (>= 1.0)\r\n\r\n## Mailing List\r\n\r\n* <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-ruby/>\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n* [Gregg Kellogg](http://github.com/gkellogg) - <http://greggkellogg.net/>\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nThis repository uses [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) to mange development and release activity. All submissions _must_ be on a feature branch based on the _develop_ branch to ease staging and integration.\r\n\r\n* Do your best to adhere to the existing coding conventions and idioms.\r\n* Don't use hard tabs, and don't leave trailing whitespace on any line.\r\n  Before committing, run `git diff --check` to make sure of this.\r\n* Do document every method you add using [YARD][] annotations. Read the\r\n  [tutorial][YARD-GS] or just look at the existing code for examples.\r\n* Don't touch the `.gemspec` or `VERSION` files. If you need to change them,\r\n  do so on your private branch only.\r\n* Do feel free to add yourself to the `CREDITS` file and the\r\n  corresponding list in the the `README`. Alphabetical order applies.\r\n* Don't touch the `AUTHORS` file. If your contributions are significant\r\n  enough, be assured we will eventually add you in there.\r\n* Do note that in order for us to merge any non-trivial changes (as a rule\r\n  of thumb, additions larger than about 15 lines of code), we need an\r\n  explicit [public domain dedication][PDD] on record from you.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis is free and unencumbered public domain software.
